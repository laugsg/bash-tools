Track files listing them and prevent unhandled bulk staging from global commands like `git add .` Add, commit and push made easy only for the files you are working on.

# (required) commit message
# (required) branch
pr [commit message] [branch]
```

* [ ] path option : pr [path] ...
* [ ] check required options
